        My name is Samyar Shafiee, and I am an immigrant who came to Canada in 2022 with limited English skills but an ambitious spirit. Within my first year, I won the Grade 8 Math Award and earned a spot on the Honour Roll.
        <br><br>
        Transitioning to high school was a challenge, particularly in the IB program, but I persevered. Through dedication and hard work, I improved my average by 10% across all subjects, proving that resilience leads to success.
