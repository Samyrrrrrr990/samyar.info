    <p class="content">
      My name is Samyar Shafiee, and my journey is one of resilience and ambition. I immigrated to Canada in 2022 with limited English skills but a strong desire to succeed. Within my first year, I won the Grade 8 Math Award and achieved Honour Roll.  
      <br><br>
      High school came with new challenges, especially in the IB program, but I worked hard to raise my grades by 10% across all subjects. These experiences shaped me into a determined learner with a passion for growth.
